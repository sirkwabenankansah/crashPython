# # Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method
# # The sort() method changes the order of the list permanently.
# # And we can never revert to the original order
#
# cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
# cars.sort()  # the order of the list permanently changed > alpha order
# print(cars)
#
#
# # sort this list in reverse-alphabetical order by passing the
# # argument reverse=True to the sort() method
#
# cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
# cars.sort(reverse=True)  # the order of the list permanently changed > reverse alpha order
# print(cars)

# Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function
# the sorted() Function is Temporary

# cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
# print("\nHere is the sorted list: ")
# print(sorted(cars))
#
#
# cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
# print("\nHere is the original list again: ")
# print(cars)


# Printing a List in Reverse order
# Notice that reverse() doesnâ€™t sort backward alphabetically; it simply
# reverses the order of the list

# cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
# print(cars)
#
# cars.reverse()
# print(cars)


# Finding the Length of a List
# You can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function. The list

# in this example has four items, so its length is 4

cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
len(cars)
